# Command Line Comic App
Command line application to retrieve comic information using the Marvel API built with Node.js

## How it works
1. Open terminal/command line to project directory
2. Enter node app.js and the name of one or more Marvel comic characters. Note: Character names with spaces have to be in double quotes


## Requirements
-	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - this project uses v.0.12.7
-	[Marvel API](http://developer.marvel.com/docs) public and private keys

### Future Improvement Ideas
- List Marvel attribution once when multiple names are entered
- Include a prompt to search multiple times without having to enter node app.js each time
